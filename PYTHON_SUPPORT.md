# Supported Versions of Python

## Policy

The DomainTools API library will support all versions of Python that are actively maintained by the Python 
Software Foundation. When a version of Python enters End of Life (EOL), the API library will also end support
for that version of Python. 

When a version's End of Life date is reached, DomainTools will ensure that a release of the API library that 
contains all changes up to that point in time is available. If a release already exists that has all
changes at the point of a version's EOL date, no new one will be made. Any changes (features, bugfixes, etc) 
released after an EOL date will not be tested on the now-unsupported version.

Versions of Python from other organizations (e.g. cython, pypy, jython) will not be actively supported. DomainTools 
will not develop specifically for those versions of Python, but we welcome community assistance (such as pull 
requests) to support them.

### Python 2

DomainTools API library support for Python 2.7 (and all Python 2) will end on November 30, 2020. 

### Python 3.5

DomainTools will continue to support Python 3.5 until November 30, 2020. 

## Upcoming Timeline:

- Support for Python 2.7 will end on Nov 30, 2020
- Support for Python 3.5 will end on Nov 30, 2020
